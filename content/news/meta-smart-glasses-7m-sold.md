Remember when smart glasses were a joke? Google Glass was a punchline. Snap Spectacles were a novelty. Now **Meta has sold 7 million AI-powered Ray-Bans in a single year** — triple what they sold in 2023 and 2024 combined.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri confirmed the numbers: "In 2025, we sold more than 7 million units of AI glasses, posting exponential growth."

## Why Now?

Three things changed:

1. **They look normal** — Ray-Ban frames, not face computers. Nobody knows you're wearing AI glasses unless you tell them.

2. **AI got useful** — Meta's Llama-powered assistant can see what you see, answer questions, translate languages, and identify objects. It went from gimmick to genuinely helpful.

3. **Price point** — Starting around $299, they're expensive sunglasses but cheap AI hardware. Accessible enough for mainstream adoption.

## The Road to 10 Million

EssilorLuxottica previously said they'd hit 10 million units/year by 2027. At this growth rate, they might hit it in 2026. The company hinted that prices will stay high in the short term as they prioritise margins over volume.

## What This Means for AI Agents

Smart glasses are the first truly wearable AI agent platform. The form factor — always on, camera-equipped, voice-activated — is ideal for an always-available assistant.

Imagine an OpenClaw agent connected to your glasses: it sees what you see, hears what you hear, and can quietly surface information when relevant. That's not science fiction anymore — it's a product you can buy today.

## The Privacy Elephant

7 million cameras walking around, connected to AI. The privacy implications are enormous and largely unresolved. Meta's approach so far: a small LED light that turns on during recording. Whether that's sufficient is debatable.
