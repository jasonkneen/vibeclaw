Zoë Hitzig, a researcher who left OpenAI this week, published an op-ed in the New York Times expressing "deep reservations" about OpenAI's decision to put ads in ChatGPT.

Her concern isn't about ads existing — it's about what ads *do* to an AI assistant that millions of people trust for advice.

## The Problem With AI Ads

When you ask ChatGPT for a product recommendation, medication advice, or financial guidance, you're trusting it to be neutral. Ads break that trust:

> "The real question is not ads or no ads. It is whether we can design structures that avoid both excluding people from using these tools, and potentially manipulating them as consumers."

Think about it:
- "What laptop should I buy?" → Sponsored answer from Dell
- "What's good for headaches?" → Promoted response from Advil
- "How should I invest my savings?" → Ad-supported financial product

The line between helpful answer and advertisement becomes invisible.

## Why OpenAI Is Doing It

Money. ChatGPT is expensive to run. GPT-5 reportedly cost over $1 billion to train. Subscriptions alone can't cover the burn rate. Ads are the proven model for monetising free-tier users.

## The Open Source Alternative

This is exactly why open-source AI matters. When you run your own agent — through OpenClaw, through local models, through VibeClaw — there are no ads. No sponsored responses. No invisible manipulation.

Your agent works for you, not for advertisers.

## The Bigger Trend

Google's Gemini will likely follow. Microsoft's Copilot already has ad-adjacent features. The free tier of every major AI assistant is going to be ad-supported within a year.

The question for users: **do you want an AI assistant that serves you, or one that serves advertisers?**
