The AI copyright battle just got a new front. **Disney has hit ByteDance with a cease and desist** over their new Seedance 2.0 AI video generation model, which can apparently generate videos featuring Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and other Disney-owned characters.

## What Happened

ByteDance launched Seedance 2.0, their latest AI video generation model, and users quickly discovered it could create videos featuring copyrighted characters with alarming accuracy.

Disney's attorney was blunt: "ByteDance is hijacking Disney's characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters."

## The Bigger Problem

This isn't just a Disney problem. Every AI video and image model trained on internet data has absorbed copyrighted characters, styles, and likenesses. The question isn't whether models *can* generate Mickey Mouse — it's whether they *should*.

Current legal approaches:

- **Disney/Hollywood**: Aggressive cease and desist, litigate early
- **Getty Images**: Already sued Stability AI, awaiting ruling
- **Music industry**: Suing over AI-generated songs mimicking artists
- **NYT vs OpenAI**: The landmark text case, still ongoing

## What It Means for Open Source

Open-source models face the same risk. If ByteDance gets hit for Seedance, what about open models on HuggingFace that can generate copyrighted characters?

The likely outcome: models will need built-in content filters, similar to how Dall-E refuses certain prompts. Open-source models without these filters may face distribution challenges.

## The Agent Angle

For AI agent builders, this is a reminder: **the model you choose matters legally, not just technically.** Using a model that generates copyrighted content in a commercial product puts you at risk, even if the model itself is "free."

Stick to text models for now. The copyright landscape for image and video AI is still a minefield.
