Alibaba's **Qwen3 235B** introduces something genuinely new: **hybrid thinking mode**.

## Fast Mode vs Think Mode

Most reasoning models are always-on thinkers. They burn through tokens deliberating even simple questions. Qwen3 lets you toggle:

- **Fast mode**: Direct answers, minimal overhead. Like talking to GPT-4.
- **Think mode**: Full chain-of-thought reasoning. Like talking to o3.

You can switch mid-conversation, or let the model decide based on query complexity.

## 119 Languages

Qwen3 isn't just big — it's the most multilingual open model available. 119 languages with genuine competence, not just "technically supports" quality.

For teams building agents that serve global users, this matters.
