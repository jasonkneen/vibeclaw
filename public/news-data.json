    "html": "<p>Microsoft's <strong>Phi-4 Reasoning</strong> might be the most important small model of 2026.</p>\n<h2>Why 14B Matters</h2>\n<p>The AI industry has a size problem.

Phi-4 changes the equation:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>14B parameters</strong> — runs on a MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM</li>\n<li><strong>MIT license</strong> — do literally anything with it, commercially, no restrictions</li>\n<li><strong>Reasoning-first</strong> — trained specifically for chain-of-thought, not just next-token prediction</li>\n<li><strong>Beats Llama 3.1 70B</strong> on several reasoning benchmarks at 1/5th the size</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benchmarks That Matter</h2>\n<table><tr><td>Task</td><td>Phi-4 14B</td><td>Llama 3.1 70B</td><td>Gemma 3 27B</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table><tr><td>GSM8K</td><td>92.1%</td><td>90.5%</td><td>88.7%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>HumanEval</td><td>81.3%</td><td>80.1%</td><td>76.4%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>MMLU</td><td>78.9%</td><td>82.0%</td><td>79.5%</td></tr>\n</table>\nIt doesn't win everything. But for a model you can run on a laptop? These numbers are absurd.\n<h2>The MIT License Difference</h2>\n<p>Most \"open\" models come with caveats. Meta's community license has usage thresholds. Google's Gemma has acceptable use policies. Microsoft just said \"MIT\" and walked away.</p>\n<p>For startups building products on top of AI models, this matters enormously. No legal review needed. No usage caps. No \"we might change the terms later.\"</p>\n<h2>Run It Locally</h2>\n<p>Phi-4 Reasoning is available through Ollama, llama.cpp, and most local inference frameworks.

It should support adding todos, marking them complete, deleting them, and persisting to localStorage. Use vanilla JS, no frameworks. Make it look decent.</blockquote>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<h3>🥇 DeepSeek R1</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~45 seconds (long thinking chain)\n<strong>Result</strong>: Perfect. Clean code, good CSS, localStorage working, even added a filter for active/completed. Over-engineered slightly but everything worked first try.\n<h3>🥈 Solar Pro 3</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~8 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Excellent. Clean, minimal, everything worked. Slightly less polished CSS than DeepSeek but the code was arguably cleaner. Best speed-to-quality ratio.\n<h3>🥉 Qwen3 8B</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~12 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Good. Working app, decent styling. Minor issue with the delete button not having hover states. localStorage worked fine.\n<h3>4th — Gemma 3 4B</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~10 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Functional but basic. The CSS was minimal — white background, no border-radius, felt like 2015. But the logic was correct.\n<h3>5th — Llama 3.1 8B</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~15 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Mostly worked but had a bug — completed todos lost their state on page refresh due to a JSON serialisation issue. The code structure was good but needed a fix.\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<strong>For coding tasks</strong>: DeepSeek R1 wins on quality, Solar Pro 3 wins on speed. Both are free.\n<strong>For quick answers</strong>: Solar Pro 3 is the best default — fast, accurate, and doesn't burn tokens thinking out loud.\n<strong>The surprise</strong>: Gemma 3 at 4B parameters held its own against 8B models. Google's training data is doing work.\n<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>\n<p>All five models are available for free at <a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vibeclaw.dev</a>.

As of February 2026, the usable ones include:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Solar Pro 3</strong> (Upstage) — fast, reliable, great for general chat</li>\n<li><strong>Llama 3.1 8B</strong> (Meta) — solid all-rounder</li>\n<li><strong>Gemma 3 4B</strong> (Google) — surprisingly good for its size</li>\n<li><strong>Qwen3 8B</strong> (Alibaba) — strong multilingual support</li>\n<li><strong>DeepSeek R1</strong> — reasoning beast, free distilled version</li>\n<li><strong>Phi-4 Reasoning</strong> (Microsoft) — MIT licensed, great for code</li>\n<li><strong>Mistral Small 3.1</strong> (Mistral) — Apache 2.0, fast</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Limits</h2>\n<p>Free models have rate limits, but they're generous for individual use:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>~20 requests/minute</strong> for most models</li>\n<li><strong>~200 requests/day</strong> soft cap (varies by model)</li>\n<li><strong>Queue priority</strong> — paid users get faster responses during peak times</li>\n<li><strong>No SLA</strong> — if a free model goes down, there's no guarantee on uptime</li>\n</ul>\nFor building and testing agents?

Every framework has its own way of connecting models to tools. <strong>MCP is trying to fix that.</strong></p>\n<h2>What Is MCP?</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol</strong> is a standard way for AI models to discover and use tools. Instead of every app building custom integrations, MCP defines a universal interface:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Server</strong> advertises available tools (search, code execution, file access, etc.)\n2. <strong>Client</strong> (the AI model/agent) discovers tools and their schemas\n3. <strong>Communication</strong> happens over a standard JSON-RPC protocol</p>\n<p>Think of it like USB — plug in any device, it just works.</p>\n<h2>Why It's Winning</h2>\n<p>MCP has been adopted by 50+ frameworks in under a year. Why?</p>\n<strong>For developers:</strong>\n<ul><li>Write a tool once, use it everywhere</li>\n<li>No more maintaining separate plugins for Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.</li>\n<li>Standard testing and debugging</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For users:</strong>\n<ul><li>Tools work the same regardless of which model you're using</li>\n<li>Switch models without losing tool access</li>\n<li>Composable — mix tools from different providers</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For model providers:</strong>\n<ul><li>Don't need to build their own tool ecosystem</li>\n<li>Can focus on model quality, not integration plumbing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In Practice</h2>\n<p>An MCP server for, say, GitHub looks like this: it exposes tools like <code>create_issue</code>, <code>list_prs</code>, <code>search_code</code>. Any MCP-compatible client can discover and use them. OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf — they all speak MCP.</p>\n<p>VibeClaw supports MCP servers in its agent configurations. You can add tools in the Forge builder and they'll work with any model you choose.</p>\n<h2>The Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>The MCP server registry is growing fast. Popular servers include:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Filesystem</strong> — read/write/search files</li>\n<li><strong>GitHub</strong> — issues, PRs, code search</li>\n<li><strong>Brave Search</strong> — web search</li>\n<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> — database queries</li>\n<li><strong>Puppeteer</strong> — browser automation</li>\n</ul>\nAnd hundreds more.

This config can be loaded into any OpenClaw instance.</p>\n<h2>Running It</h2>\n<p>Import the config into your OpenClaw server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">openclaw config import devops-agent.vibeclaw.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set up a cron schedule to run it every 15 minutes, and you've got a free AI-powered monitoring system.</p>\n<h2>Why This Works</h2>\n<p>The magic isn't in the model — it's in the <strong>system prompt + tools</strong> combination. A well-instructed Solar Pro 3 with shell access can do 80% of what expensive monitoring tools do. For free.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev/forge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VibeClaw Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.openclaw.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenClaw Docs</a></li></ul>"

    "html": "<p>Everyone assumes you need expensive models to build useful AI agents. <strong>We disagree.</strong></p>\n<h2>The Pricing Landscape</h2>\n<p>Here's what the top models cost per million tokens (as of February 2026):</p>\n<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Input $/M</td><td>Output $/M</td><td>Quality Tier</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table><tr><td>Claude Opus 4.6</td><td>$15.00</td><td>$75.00</td><td>Frontier</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPT-5.2</td><td>$12.00</td><td>$60.00</td><td>Frontier</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Claude Sonnet 4</td><td>$3.00</td><td>$15.00</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPT-5</td><td>$5.00</td><td>$25.00</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gemini 3 Pro</td><td>$3.50</td><td>$10.50</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Solar Pro 3</td><td>FREE</td><td>FREE</td><td>Good</td></tr>\n<tr><td>DeepSeek R1</td><td>FREE</td><td>FREE</td><td>Strong+</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Qwen3 8B</td><td>FREE</td><td>FREE</td><td>Good</td></tr>\n</table>\n<h2>What Does an Agent Actually Cost?</h2>\n<p>A typical agent conversation uses 2,000-5,000 tokens per turn. Let's say 50 turns per day for a busy personal assistant:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Claude Opus 4.6</strong>: ~$15-20/day → <strong>$450-600/month</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Claude Sonnet 4</strong>: ~$2-4/day → <strong>$60-120/month</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Solar Pro 3</strong>: $0/day → <strong>$0/month</strong></li>\n</ul>\nThat's the raw compute. Add in tool calls, and Opus users are looking at $500+/month for a heavy-use agent.\n<h2>Where Free Models Win</h2>\n<p>For 80% of agent tasks, free models are genuinely good enough:</p>\n<ul><li>✅ Reading and summarising emails</li>\n<li>✅ Managing calendars and reminders</li>\n<li>✅ Writing messages and drafts</li>\n<li>✅ Basic code generation</li>\n<li>✅ File organisation</li>\n<li>✅ Web search and research</li>\n<li>✅ Home automation commands</li>\n</ul>\nSolar Pro 3 handles all of these without breaking a sweat.\n<h2>Where You Need to Pay</h2>\n<p>The remaining 20% is where frontier models earn their cost:</p>\n<ul><li>❌ Complex multi-step reasoning chains</li>\n<li>❌ Novel code architecture decisions</li>\n<li>❌ Long document analysis (100K+ tokens)</li>\n<li>❌ Nuanced creative writing</li>\n<li>❌ Vision-heavy tasks</li>\n<li>❌ Tasks requiring maximum reliability</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Smart Strategy</h2>\n<p>Use <strong>free models as your default</strong> and <strong>route to paid models when needed</strong>. VibeClaw (and OpenClaw) support model switching per task. Run Solar Pro 3 for routine stuff, escalate to Claude when it matters.</p>\n<p>This hybrid approach can cut your AI costs by 80-90% while maintaining quality where it counts.</p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>You don't need a $500/month AI budget to build useful agents. Start free. Upgrade selectively. The models are good enough — the real value is in the <strong>tools and prompts</strong> you connect them to.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenRouter Pricing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Start free at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"

    "html": "<p>Google doesn't get enough credit for Gemma. While Meta and Alibaba dominate the open-source AI headlines, <strong>Gemma 3</strong> has been quietly winning on the metrics that matter for real-world use.</p>\n<h2>The Lineup</h2>\n<table><tr><td>Variant</td><td>Parameters</td><td>VRAM</td><td>Speed</td><td>License</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table><tr><td>Gemma 3 4B</td><td>4B</td><td>3GB</td><td>Very fast</td><td>Google</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gemma 3 12B</td><td>12B</td><td>8GB</td><td>Fast</td><td>Google</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gemma 3 27B</td><td>27B</td><td>16GB</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Google</td></tr>\n</table>\nThe 4B model runs on basically anything — phones, Raspberry Pis, old laptops. The 27B model fits on a single consumer GPU.\n<h2>Why Gemma Wins on Efficiency</h2>\n<p>Google's distillation process is genuinely best-in-class. Gemma 3 4B outperforms models 2-3x its size on practical tasks:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Instruction following</strong>: Better than Llama 3.1 8B at following complex multi-step instructions</li>\n<li><strong>Code generation</strong>: Competitive with Phi-4 at nearly 1/3 the parameters</li>\n<li><strong>Multilingual</strong>: Strong across European and Asian languages</li>\n<li><strong>Structured output</strong>: Excellent at generating valid JSON and XML</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The \"Google License\" Question</h2>\n<p>Gemma isn't Apache 2.0 or MIT. It uses Google's own license, which is permissive but includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Acceptable use restrictions (no weapons, surveillance, etc.)</li>\n<li>A 30-day cure period for violations</li>\n<li>Google's standard IP indemnification</li>\n</ul>\nFor most developers and businesses, this is fine. But if you need maximum legal simplicity, Phi-4 (MIT) or Mistral Small (Apache 2.0) might be safer bets.\n<h2>The Secret Weapon: Multimodal</h2>\n<p>Gemma 3's vision variants can process images alongside text. At 4B parameters, that's remarkable. You can build a visual assistant that runs on a phone.</p>\n<h2>Try It</h2>\n<p>Gemma 3 4B is free on OpenRouter and available in <a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VibeClaw</a>. It's our recommended model for low-latency applications where speed matters more than maximum capability.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-27b-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HuggingFace: google/gemma-3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google AI Blog</a></li></ul>"
