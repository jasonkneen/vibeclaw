    "html": "<p>David Greene, former host of NPR's Morning Edition and current host of Left, Right & Center, is suing Google. The claim: Google's male podcast host voice in NotebookLM is an unauthorised copy of his voice.</p>\n<p>Greene says the resemblance is \"uncanny,\" and friends and colleagues agree. Google denies it, but the case raises questions that the entire AI industry needs to answer.</p>\n<h2>The Voice Problem</h2>\n<p>AI voice cloning has gotten scarily good. Modern TTS systems can replicate a voice from just a few seconds of audio. The question of consent — did the original speaker agree to their voice being used in training data? — is largely unanswered.</p>\n<p>Greene's case is particularly interesting because:\n<ul><li>He's a <strong>professional</strong> whose voice is his primary asset</li>\n<li>The AI voice is used in a <strong>commercial product</strong> (NotebookLM)</li>\n<li>The resemblance is specific enough that colleagues recognised it</li>\n<li>Google hasn't disclosed their voice training data sources</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Legal Landscape</h2></p>\n<p>Voice rights are murky. Some jurisdictions have \"right of publicity\" laws that protect distinctive voices (the Bette Midler case set precedent in 1988). But applying 20th-century publicity law to AI training data is untested territory.</p>\n<p>If Greene wins, it could:\n<ul><li>Force AI companies to disclose voice training data</li>\n<li>Require consent from people whose voices are used</li>\n<li>Create a licensing market for professional voices</li>\n<li>Make AI voice companies much more careful about their datasets</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What It Means for AI Voice Tools</h2></p>\n<p>Tools like ElevenLabs, OpenAI's TTS, and Google's own voice synthesis are all potentially affected. If courts rule that AI voices trained on copyrighted speech require consent, the entire industry's training pipeline changes.</p>\n<p>For builders using TTS in their agents: choose providers that use licensed, consented voices. It's both ethical and legally safer.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/15/david-greene-google-ai-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Washington Post Coverage</a></li></ul>"

The developer's job shifts from writing to reviewing, testing, and directing.</p>\n<p>It's not lazy. It's leverage. A senior developer who understands architecture, patterns, and edge cases can now ship 5x more code by directing an AI than by typing it themselves.</p>\n<h2>The Numbers</h2>\n<p>The impact at scale is staggering:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Spotify</strong>: Senior devs writing zero code since December 2025</li>\n<li><strong>Google</strong>: Reports that 40% of new code is AI-generated</li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Claims 50% productivity gains for Copilot users</li>\n<li><strong>Meta</strong>: Internal tools team reduced from 80 to 30 engineers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for AI Agents</h2>\n<p>If the best developers at a $100B company are using AI to write code, the tools matter enormously.

Every AI video and image model trained on internet data has absorbed copyrighted characters, styles, and likenesses. The question isn't whether models <em>can</em> generate Mickey Mouse — it's whether they <em>should</em>.</p>\n<p>Current legal approaches:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Disney/Hollywood</strong>: Aggressive cease and desist, litigate early</li>\n<li><strong>Getty Images</strong>: Already sued Stability AI, awaiting ruling</li>\n<li><strong>Music industry</strong>: Suing over AI-generated songs mimicking artists</li>\n<li><strong>NYT vs OpenAI</strong>: The landmark text case, still ongoing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What It Means for Open Source</h2>\n<p>Open-source models face the same risk. If ByteDance gets hit for Seedance, what about open models on HuggingFace that can generate copyrighted characters?</p>\n<p>The likely outcome: models will need built-in content filters, similar to how Dall-E refuses certain prompts. Open-source models without these filters may face distribution challenges.</p>\n<h2>The Agent Angle</h2>\n<p>For AI agent builders, this is a reminder: <strong>the model you choose matters legally, not just technically.</strong> Using a model that generates copyrighted content in a commercial product puts you at risk, even if the model itself is \"free.\"</p>\n<p>Stick to text models for now.

Ads break that trust:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The real question is not ads or no ads. It is whether we can design structures that avoid both excluding people from using these tools, and potentially manipulating them as consumers.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Think about it:\n<ul><li>\"What laptop should I buy?\" → Sponsored answer from Dell</li>\n<li>\"What's good for headaches?\" → Promoted response from Advil</li>\n<li>\"How should I invest my savings?\" → Ad-supported financial product</li>\n</ul>\nThe line between helpful answer and advertisement becomes invisible.</p>\n<h2>Why OpenAI Is Doing It</h2>\n<p>Money. ChatGPT is expensive to run. GPT-5 reportedly cost over $1 billion to train. Subscriptions alone can't cover the burn rate. Ads are the proven model for monetising free-tier users.</p>\n<h2>The Open Source Alternative</h2>\n<p>This is exactly why open-source AI matters. When you run your own agent — through OpenClaw, through local models, through VibeClaw — there are no ads. No sponsored responses. No invisible manipulation.</p>\n<p>Your agent works for you, not for advertisers.</p>\n<h2>The Bigger Trend</h2>\n<p>Google's Gemini will likely follow. Microsoft's Copilot already has ad-adjacent features. The free tier of every major AI assistant is going to be ad-supported within a year.</p>\n<p>The question for users: <strong>do you want an AI assistant that serves you, or one that serves advertisers?</strong></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NYT Op-Ed: Zoë Hitzig</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Run ad-free AI agents at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"

Clean code, good CSS, localStorage working, even added a filter for active/completed. Over-engineered slightly but everything worked first try.\n<h3>🥈 Solar Pro 3</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~8 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Excellent. Clean, minimal, everything worked. Slightly less polished CSS than DeepSeek but the code was arguably cleaner. Best speed-to-quality ratio.\n<h3>🥉 Qwen3 8B</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~12 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Good. Working app, decent styling. Minor issue with the delete button not having hover states. localStorage worked fine.\n<h3>4th — Gemma 3 4B</h3>\n<strong>Time</strong>: ~10 seconds\n<strong>Result</strong>: Functional but basic.

The code structure was good but needed a fix.\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<strong>For coding tasks</strong>: DeepSeek R1 wins on quality, Solar Pro 3 wins on speed. Both are free.\n<strong>For quick answers</strong>: Solar Pro 3 is the best default — fast, accurate, and doesn't burn tokens thinking out loud.\n<strong>The surprise</strong>: Gemma 3 at 4B parameters held its own against 8B models.

Nobody knows you're wearing AI glasses unless you tell them.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>AI got useful</strong> — Meta's Llama-powered assistant can see what you see, answer questions, translate languages, and identify objects. It went from gimmick to genuinely helpful.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Price point</strong> — Starting around $299, they're expensive sunglasses but cheap AI hardware. Accessible enough for mainstream adoption.</p>\n<h2>The Road to 10 Million</h2>\n<p>EssilorLuxottica previously said they'd hit 10 million units/year by 2027. At this growth rate, they might hit it in 2026. The company hinted that prices will stay high in the short term as they prioritise margins over volume.</p>\n<h2>What This Means for AI Agents</h2>\n<p>Smart glasses are the first truly wearable AI agent platform. The form factor — always on, camera-equipped, voice-activated — is ideal for an always-available assistant.</p>\n<p>Imagine an OpenClaw agent connected to your glasses: it sees what you see, hears what you hear, and can quietly surface information when relevant. That's not science fiction anymore — it's a product you can buy today.</p>\n<h2>The Privacy Elephant</h2>\n<p>7 million cameras walking around, connected to AI. The privacy implications are enormous and largely unresolved. Meta's approach so far: a small LED light that turns on during recording. Whether that's sufficient is debatable.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ESLOF/earnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EssilorLuxottica Earnings Call</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a></li></ul>"

    "html": "<p>Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made a striking claim to the Financial Times:</p>\n<blockquote>\"White-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.\"</blockquote>\n<h2>Parsing the Claim</h2>\n<p>Let's be precise about what he said: <strong>most tasks</strong>, not most jobs. There's a crucial difference.</p>\n<p>An accountant's job includes data entry, categorisation, report generation, and compliance checks — many of which are already partially automated. But it also includes client relationships, judgement calls on ambiguous situations, and regulatory interpretation. AI handles the former well. The latter? Not yet.</p>\n<h2>What's Actually Happening</h2>\n<p>The reality is somewhere between \"nothing's changed\" and Suleyman's bold timeline:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Legal</strong>: AI drafts contracts and reviews documents, but lawyers still argue cases and advise clients</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting</strong>: AI handles bookkeeping and basic tax prep, humans handle strategy and audit</li>\n<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: AI generates copy and analyses data, humans handle brand strategy and creative direction</li>\n<li><strong>Project management</strong>: AI tracks tasks and generates reports, humans handle people and politics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Agent Connection</h2>\n<p>AI agents are the bridge between \"AI can do individual tasks\" and \"AI handles entire workflows.\" When you connect a language model to tools — email, calendar, databases, code execution — it stops being a chatbot and starts being a worker.</p>\n<p>That's what OpenClaw and VibeClaw are building toward. Not replacing people, but giving them AI workers that handle the repetitive 80% so they can focus on the 20% that requires human judgment.</p>\n<h2>The 18-Month Test</h2>\n<p>Set a reminder for August 2027. If most white-collar tasks are fully automated by then, Suleyman was right. Our prediction? He's directionally correct but 3-5 years early on \"most.\"</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1ec830c-2f08-4b1a-b70f-7330f260753c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Financial Times Interview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Build AI agents at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"

    "html": "<p>Remember when every phone had a different charger? That's AI tool integration right now. Every framework has its own way of connecting models to tools. <strong>MCP is trying to fix that.</strong></p>\n<h2>What Is MCP?</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol</strong> is a standard way for AI models to discover and use tools. Instead of every app building custom integrations, MCP defines a universal interface:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Server</strong> advertises available tools (search, code execution, file access, etc.)\n2. <strong>Client</strong> (the AI model/agent) discovers tools and their schemas\n3. <strong>Communication</strong> happens over a standard JSON-RPC protocol</p>\n<p>Think of it like USB — plug in any device, it just works.</p>\n<h2>Why It's Winning</h2>\n<p>MCP has been adopted by 50+ frameworks in under a year. Why?</p>\n<strong>For developers:</strong>\n<ul><li>Write a tool once, use it everywhere</li>\n<li>No more maintaining separate plugins for Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.</li>\n<li>Standard testing and debugging</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For users:</strong>\n<ul><li>Tools work the same regardless of which model you're using</li>\n<li>Switch models without losing tool access</li>\n<li>Composable — mix tools from different providers</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For model providers:</strong>\n<ul><li>Don't need to build their own tool ecosystem</li>\n<li>Can focus on model quality, not integration plumbing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In Practice</h2>\n<p>An MCP server for, say, GitHub looks like this: it exposes tools like <code>create_issue</code>, <code>list_prs</code>, <code>search_code</code>. Any MCP-compatible client can discover and use them. OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf — they all speak MCP.</p>\n<p>VibeClaw supports MCP servers in its agent configurations. You can add tools in the Forge builder and they'll work with any model you choose.</p>\n<h2>The Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>The MCP server registry is growing fast. Popular servers include:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Filesystem</strong> — read/write/search files</li>\n<li><strong>GitHub</strong> — issues, PRs, code search</li>\n<li><strong>Brave Search</strong> — web search</li>\n<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> — database queries</li>\n<li><strong>Puppeteer</strong> — browser automation</li>\n</ul>\nAnd hundreds more. The composability is the killer feature — combine a GitHub server with a code execution server and a search server, and your agent can research, implement, and ship code autonomously.\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MCP Specification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MCP Server Registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev/forge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Build agents with MCP at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"

This pre-fills sensible defaults:</p>\n<ul><li>Model: Solar Pro 3 (free, fast, reliable)</li>\n<li>System prompt: DevOps-focused instructions</li>\n<li>Tools: filesystem, shell execution</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2: Customize the System Prompt (60 seconds)</h2>\n<p>Replace the default system prompt with something specific:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-text\">You are a DevOps monitoring agent. Every time you run:\n1. Check server uptime and load average\n2. Scan /var/log/syslog for ERROR or CRITICAL entries from the last hour\n3. Check disk usage — alert if any partition is over 85%\n4. Check if nginx/apache is responding on port 80\n5. Report findings concisely. Only alert me if something needs attention.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 3: Add MCP Servers (60 seconds)</h2>\n<p>In the Tools step, add:\n<ul><li><strong>Filesystem server</strong> — so the agent can read log files</li>\n<li><strong>Shell server</strong> — so it can run commands like <code>df -h</code> and <code>curl localhost</code></li>\n</ul>\nVibeClaw's Forge has these as one-click additions.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Save & Export (30 seconds)</h2>\n<p>Hit Save to add it to your library.

    "summary": "OpenClaw supports MCP out of the box. Here are the 10 servers that make your agent genuinely useful.",
    "html": "<p>OpenClaw speaks MCP natively. That means any MCP server — official or community — plugs in and works. But with hundreds available, which ones are actually worth installing?</p>\n<p>We tested dozens. Here are our top 10.</p>\n<h2>1. Filesystem Server</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Read, write, search, and manage files\n<strong>Why</strong>: Every agent needs file access. This is the foundation.\n<strong>Config</strong>: Point it at your workspace directory and your agent can organise, edit, and search files.\n<h2>2. Brave Search</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Web search via Brave's API\n<strong>Why</strong>: Your agent can research anything in real time. Free tier is generous.\n<strong>Setup</strong>: Get a free API key from search.brave.com\n<h2>3. GitHub</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Issues, PRs, code search, repo management\n<strong>Why</strong>: If you code, this is essential. Your agent can create issues, review PRs, search codebases.\n<strong>Highlight</strong>: Natural language issue creation — describe a bug, agent files it with labels and assignees.\n<h2>4. PostgreSQL / SQLite</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Database queries and schema inspection\n<strong>Why</strong>: Ask questions about your data in plain English. \"How many users signed up this week?\"\n<strong>Caution</strong>: Use read-only credentials unless you trust your agent with writes.\n<h2>5. Puppeteer / Playwright</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Browser automation\n<strong>Why</strong>: Your agent can navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract data.\n<strong>Use case</strong>: Monitoring dashboards, scraping prices, testing web apps.\n<h2>6. Memory (Vector Store)</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Persistent memory with semantic search\n<strong>Why</strong>: Give your agent long-term memory across sessions. \"Remember that meeting notes from last Tuesday.\"\n<strong>Options</strong>: ChromaDB, Qdrant, or simple file-based stores.\n<h2>7. Slack / Discord</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Channel management, message search, user lookup\n<strong>Why</strong>: Your agent can search conversation history, summarise channels, find messages.\n<strong>Note</strong>: Separate from OpenClaw's built-in channel support — this is for <em>reading</em> history, not sending messages.\n<h2>8. Google Workspace</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets\n<strong>Why</strong>: Full Google Workspace integration. Read emails, manage calendar, search Drive.\n<strong>Setup</strong>: OAuth flow, one-time consent.\n<h2>9. Docker</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Container management\n<strong>Why</strong>: Your agent can start, stop, inspect, and manage Docker containers.\n<strong>Use case</strong>: DevOps automation, spinning up test environments, monitoring services.\n<h2>10. Notion</h2>\n<strong>What</strong>: Page and database CRUD\n<strong>Why</strong>: If your team uses Notion, your agent can read and update pages, query databases, create entries.\n<h2>How to Add MCP Servers to OpenClaw</h2>\n<p>In your <code>openclaw.json</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/path/to/workspace\"]\n    },\n    \"brave-search\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search\"],\n      \"env\": { \"BRAVE_API_KEY\": \"your-key\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or use <strong>VibeClaw's Forge</strong> to add them visually — no JSON editing required.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MCP Server Registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.openclaw.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenClaw MCP Docs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev/forge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Build configs at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"

The 27B model fits on a single consumer GPU.\n<h2>Why Gemma Wins on Efficiency</h2>\n<p>Google's distillation process is genuinely best-in-class. Gemma 3 4B outperforms models 2-3x its size on practical tasks:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Instruction following</strong>: Better than Llama 3.1 8B at following complex multi-step instructions</li>\n<li><strong>Code generation</strong>: Competitive with Phi-4 at nearly 1/3 the parameters</li>\n<li><strong>Multilingual</strong>: Strong across European and Asian languages</li>\n<li><strong>Structured output</strong>: Excellent at generating valid JSON and XML</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The \"Google License\" Question</h2>\n<p>Gemma isn't Apache 2.0 or MIT. It uses Google's own license, which is permissive but includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Acceptable use restrictions (no weapons, surveillance, etc.)</li>\n<li>A 30-day cure period for violations</li>\n<li>Google's standard IP indemnification</li>\n</ul>\nFor most developers and businesses, this is fine. But if you need maximum legal simplicity, Phi-4 (MIT) or Mistral Small (Apache 2.0) might be safer bets.\n<h2>The Secret Weapon: Multimodal</h2>\n<p>Gemma 3's vision variants can process images alongside text. At 4B parameters, that's remarkable. You can build a visual assistant that runs on a phone.</p>\n<h2>Try It</h2>\n<p>Gemma 3 4B is free on OpenRouter and available in <a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VibeClaw</a>.

    "html": "<p>You've probably heard of ChatGPT and Copilot. OpenClaw is different. Here's the short version:</p>\n<strong>OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant that runs on your own hardware and talks to you on the apps you already use.</strong>\n<p>That's it. No cloud account. No subscription portal. No \"your data improves our models.\" Just an agent on your machine, connected to your life.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>Install it</strong> — <code>npm install -g openclaw@latest</code> on any machine with Node.js 22+\n2. <strong>Configure it</strong> — pick your AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source, whatever)\n3. <strong>Connect channels</strong> — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Teams, webchat\n4. <strong>Talk to it</strong> — message your agent like you'd message a friend</p>\n<p>The Gateway runs as a background daemon. It's always on, always listening on your channels, always ready.</p>\n<h2>What Can It Do?</h2>\n<p>OpenClaw is a framework, not a fixed product. What it does depends on how you set it up:</p>\n<strong>Out of the box:</strong>\n<ul><li>Chat on any connected messaging platform</li>\n<li>Search the web, fetch pages, read documents</li>\n<li>Run shell commands (with approval if you want)</li>\n<li>Read and write files</li>\n<li>Control a headless browser</li>\n<li>Set reminders and scheduled tasks</li>\n<li>Text to speech and speech to text</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>With skills (plugins):</strong>\n<ul><li>Manage your calendar (Google, Apple)</li>\n<li>Send emails</li>\n<li>Control smart home devices (Hue, Sonos, BluOS)</li>\n<li>Manage GitHub repos</li>\n<li>Read and write Apple Notes, Reminders, Things 3</li>\n<li>Monitor RSS feeds</li>\n<li>Connect to any MCP server</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>With paired devices:</strong>\n<ul><li>Camera access (phone, IP cameras)</li>\n<li>Screen capture</li>\n<li>Location tracking</li>\n<li>Run commands on remote machines</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Makes It Different</h2>\n<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td>ChatGPT</td><td>Copilot</td><td>OpenClaw</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table><tr><td>Runs locally</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Your data stays private</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-channel messaging</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Custom tools/skills</td><td>Limited</td><td>Limited</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Open source</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Works offline</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>Partially</td></tr>\n<tr><td>MCP support</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr>\n</table>\n<h2>The Model Question</h2>\n<p>OpenClaw works with any model provider:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Anthropic</strong> (Claude) — recommended, best prompt injection resistance</li>\n<li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (GPT) — strong alternative</li>\n<li><strong>Google</strong> (Gemini) — good multimodal</li>\n<li><strong>OpenRouter</strong> — access to hundreds of models, including free ones</li>\n<li><strong>Local models</strong> (Ollama, llama.cpp) — fully offline</li>\n</ul>\nYou can even set up fallback chains: try Claude first, fall back to GPT if it's down, fall back to a local model if you lose internet.\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The fastest way to try OpenClaw without installing anything: <strong><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VibeClaw</a></strong>. Boot a sandbox in your browser, test configurations, then export to a real server when you're ready.</p>\n<p>For a real install:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm install -g openclaw@latest\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n</code></pre>\n<p>The wizard walks you through everything.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenClaw GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting Started Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://vibeclaw.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Try in browser at VibeClaw</a></li></ul>"
