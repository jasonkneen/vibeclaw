This isn't a hit piece on ChatGPT. It's genuinely excellent. But OpenClaw solves a different problem. Here's when to use which.

## Use ChatGPT When:

- **You want zero setup** — open the app, start chatting
- **You need the latest frontier model** — GPT-5.2 is impressive
- **You want mobile-first** — the ChatGPT app is polished
- **You're a casual user** — ask questions, get answers, move on
- **You want voice conversation** — ChatGPT's voice mode is best-in-class

ChatGPT is the best "just works" AI experience available.

## Use OpenClaw When:

- **Privacy matters** — your data never leaves your machine
- **You want tool integration** — shell access, file management, browser automation, MCP servers
- **You need multi-channel** — talk to the same agent on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal
- **You want customisation** — your system prompt, your model choice, your skills
- **You're building agents** — not just chatting, but automating workflows
- **You want to use multiple models** — switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini, open-source

## The Real Difference

ChatGPT is a **product**. You use it as designed.

OpenClaw is a **framework**. You build it into whatever you need.

ChatGPT gives you a conversation interface. OpenClaw gives you an agent that lives in your infrastructure, connects to your tools, and acts on your behalf.

## Can You Use Both?

Yes. Many people do. ChatGPT for quick questions on their phone. OpenClaw for the always-on assistant that manages their server, organises their files, monitors their feeds, and answers messages across platforms.

They're complementary, not competing.

## The Cost Comparison

| | ChatGPT Free | ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) | OpenClaw + Free Models | OpenClaw + Claude Pro |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model quality | Good | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Tool access | Limited | Limited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Privacy | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-channel | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Customisation | Minimal | Minimal | Full | Full |
| Monthly cost | $0 | $20 | $0 | $20 |

Same price, very different products.
