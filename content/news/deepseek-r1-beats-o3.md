summary: "DeepSeek's R1 model matches or beats OpenAI's o3 on math and coding — and it's completely free."

DeepSeek just dropped the **R1 0528 update**, and it's embarrassing some very expensive proprietary models.

## What Changed

The R1 0528 revision brings significant improvements to the chain-of-thought reasoning:

- **AIME 2025**: 87.5% (vs o3's 83.3%)
- **Codeforces**: 2029 Elo (competitive programmer level)
- **GPQA Diamond**: 81.0% (PhD-level science questions)
- **LiveCodeBench**: Top 3 across all models tested

All of this from a model you can download and run yourself.

## The Free Model Revolution

DeepSeek R1 is available for free on OpenRouter, which means VibeClaw users get access to o3-level reasoning at zero cost. No API key, no subscription, no limits.

This is what makes open-source AI exciting — the gap between "free" and "the best money can buy" is closing fast.

## The Catch

R1's reasoning chains can be verbose. It thinks out loud — sometimes for thousands of tokens before giving you an answer. Great for complex problems, overkill for "what's the weather."

## Try It

R1 is one of the free models available in the [VibeClaw sandbox](https://vibeclaw.dev). Boot a server and switch to DeepSeek R1 in the flavour dropdown.
