David Greene, former host of NPR's Morning Edition and current host of Left, Right & Center, is suing Google. The claim: Google's male podcast host voice in NotebookLM is an unauthorised copy of his voice.

Greene says the resemblance is "uncanny," and friends and colleagues agree. Google denies it, but the case raises questions that the entire AI industry needs to answer.

## The Voice Problem

AI voice cloning has gotten scarily good. Modern TTS systems can replicate a voice from just a few seconds of audio. The question of consent — did the original speaker agree to their voice being used in training data? — is largely unanswered.

Greene's case is particularly interesting because:
- He's a **professional** whose voice is his primary asset
- The AI voice is used in a **commercial product** (NotebookLM)
- The resemblance is specific enough that colleagues recognised it
- Google hasn't disclosed their voice training data sources

## The Legal Landscape

Voice rights are murky. Some jurisdictions have "right of publicity" laws that protect distinctive voices (the Bette Midler case set precedent in 1988). But applying 20th-century publicity law to AI training data is untested territory.

If Greene wins, it could:
- Force AI companies to disclose voice training data
- Require consent from people whose voices are used
- Create a licensing market for professional voices
- Make AI voice companies much more careful about their datasets

## What It Means for AI Voice Tools

Tools like ElevenLabs, OpenAI's TTS, and Google's own voice synthesis are all potentially affected. If courts rule that AI voices trained on copyrighted speech require consent, the entire industry's training pipeline changes.

For builders using TTS in their agents: choose providers that use licensed, consented voices. It's both ethical and legally safer.
